2) secret key is 87809ede0894f81ebf0d1ff694670266, if it doesn't work then generate a new secret key and paste in .env file

    1 -> open python shell or IDLE
    2 -> Run: import secrets
    3 -> Run: secrets.token_hex(16)
    4 -> Copy the generated secret key

    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install flask
    pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
    pip install Flask-Bcrypt
    pip install Flask-Login
    pip install Flask-WTF
    pip install wtforms-validators
